INIT-001 assessed as FullStack domain: explicit requirement for both .NET 10 backend API and Angular 20+ frontend with Standalone Components and Signals. Backend requires Primary Constructors in HealthCheck controller; frontend requires Tailwind CSS v4 styling. Domain classification: **FullStack** (both API and UI components with tight design coupling via UI sketch). Key assumption: UI sketch file path was referenced but not provided in input path - awaiting clarification before visual analysis. Acceptance criteria are well-defined across build, code quality, and visual polish aspects.

Domain Classification: FullStack (as explicitly stated). Backend requires .NET 10 Web API with HealthCheck controller using Primary Constructors; Frontend requires Angular 20+ with Standalone Components and Signals. Visual analysis of design-example.png reveals a modern dashboard UI with: sidebar navigation (240px fixed), dark theme (oklch colors), 4-column metrics grid, 2-column chart layout, and responsive data table. Mobile responsiveness strategy includes sidebar collapse to hamburger/tabs and card-list view for tables. Key assumption: UI sketch represents the complete initial dashboard layout requirement. Tailwind CSS v4 explicitly specified for styling. Git branch strategy included (feature/INIT-001-greenfield).

For INIT-001 planning, interpreted the requested HealthCheck controller as a Minimal API GET /health endpoint backed by a sealed primary-constructor HealthStatusService so the solution stays aligned with the enforced .NET 10 endpoint-group standard. Standardized contract sync as C# record DTO -> TypeScript interface, enum HealthState -> string-literal union, and DateTimeOffset -> ISO 8601 string for Angular consumption.
