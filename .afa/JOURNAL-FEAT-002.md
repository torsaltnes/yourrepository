Domain classification: FullStack (explicitly stated in input). Visual analysis confirms this: 4 UI sketches depict a complete Angular+.NET application with deviation management system. Sketches analyzed: (1) deviation-filter.png - dark-theme filter panel drawer with multi-select dropdowns and date range pickers; (2) deviation-list.png - light theme main dashboard with sidebar nav, data table with badges/severity colors, and pagination; (3) deviation-process.png - dark theme multi-step process workflow with stepper, metadata panel, textarea fields, action log, and buttons; (4) deviation-register-new.png - dark theme registration form with 2-column grid layout and file upload. Key UI elements discovered: Severity badges (Critical=red, High=orange, Medium=yellow, Low=green), Process stepper with 4 steps (Register→Processing→Review→Closed), Responsive drawer/bottom-sheet pattern for filters, Dark theme preference, Tailwind CSS v4 styling. All four images use Norwegian labels indicating a localized HSE/quality management system. Scope is clearly defined: CRUD operations, in-memory storage, Angular Signals/Reactive Forms, .NET Web API with ProblemDetails, no auth/authn for demo. No features beyond deviation management are implied in the input.

Visual analysis completed for FEAT-002: 4 UI sketches analyzed (deviation-filter, deviation-list, deviation-process, deviation-register-new). All images depict Norwegian-language deviation management system with consistent light theme and Tailwind-compatible color system (OKLCH). Key UI patterns identified: filter panel with cascading selects and date ranges, list view with severity badges and table columns, multi-step process form with sidebar metadata, and registration form with file uploads. Domain is confirmed as Full-Stack (Angular 20+ frontend + .NET 10 API). No technology stack ambiguity—explicitly stated. Scope is well-bounded: CRUD operations only, no authentication/authorization per spec. Assumptions: in-memory storage using singleton/ConcurrentDictionary, CORS enabled, all UI components styled with Tailwind CSS v4, and Signals-based state management in Angular confirmed as required.

For FEAT-002 planning, chose explicit step-specific Minimal API endpoints over a single generic update route because the deviation workflow has distinct validation rules, timeline events, and UI sections per phase. Preserved contract sync with record DTO -> TypeScript interface, Guid -> string, DateTimeOffset -> ISO string, and enums -> string-literal unions so the Angular 20 signals/forms layer can stay strongly typed without numeric-enum translation.

Using specialist backend/frontend implementers instead of editing files directly to comply with orchestration-only role. Frontend and backend will each read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and apply only their respective steps, then I will verify via build/test tools and redelegate if quality gates fail.

Accepted FEAT-002 after delegated backend/frontend implementations passed independent verification: dotnet build/test on Greenfield.sln and npm install/build/test on frontend all succeeded. Kept existing Tailwind 4/PostCSS and .NET local-development conventions intact while adding the new deviation workflow feature surface.

## [QualityAgent] 2026-04-29 22:24:46 UTC

Verified backend and frontend builds/tests all passed. Backend dotnet build succeeded; dotnet test passed with 38 application unit tests and 30 integration tests. Frontend npm install/build succeeded; lint script was not defined and was skipped; frontend headless tests passed with 31 tests. Swagger extraction found no build-time OpenAPI JSON under backend/obj, so no contract diff was available.
