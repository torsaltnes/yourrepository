FEAT-003 Domain Classification: FullStack (.NET backend + Angular frontend). Explicitly stated in task acceptance criteria. Business value is clear: enable skill discovery for project staffing. Scope is tightly bounded to three competence types (education, certificates, courses). No external integrations, notifications, or skill matching algorithms mentioned—keeping scope narrow. Known acceptance criteria are comprehensive and cover registration, profile display, and tech stack compliance.

Planned FEAT-003 as a user-owned CompetenceProfile aggregate with typed Education, Certificate, and Course child collections because the UI requirement is a grouped profile overview and ownership enforcement is simpler with one aggregate root. Kept repository/persistence abstraction storage-agnostic to fit the current in-memory architecture while explicitly flagging durable persistence as a production risk for employee profile data.

Implemented FEAT-003 Employee Competence Profile end-to-end.

BACKEND (32 new/modified files):
- Domain: CompetenceProfile aggregate root + EducationEntry, CertificateEntry, CourseEntry entities. Chose static factory + immutable-update pattern consistent with existing Deviation entity. GraduationYear validated against 1900..currentYear+1. ExpirationDate validated >= IssueDate. Skills normalization (trim/distinct/drop-blank) in domain entity, not just service, so the rule is enforced regardless of call site.
- Application: ICompetenceProfileRepository (get-by-employeeId + save), ICompetenceProfileService with 10 typed methods, CompetenceProfileService using primary constructor + ConfigureAwait(false). Request records use nullable string fields so binding errors on missing required fields surface as ArgumentException in service (not a 422 model-validation problem).
- Infrastructure: InMemoryCompetenceProfileRepository with ConcurrentDictionary keyed by EmployeeId (case-insensitive), plus a Clear() method for test resets.
- API: ICurrentUserContext interface + HttpCurrentUserContext implementation (IHttpContextAccessor → ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier). Placed in API project only since services take employeeId as string parameter and don't depend on the abstraction. All 10 Minimal API endpoints in CompetenceProfileEndpoints.cs — RequireAuthorization() on the group level, TypedResults throughout, ArgumentExceptions caught and returned as 400 BadRequest.
- ServiceCollectionExtensions: Added AddHttpContextAccessor, scoped ICurrentUserContext, singleton ICompetenceProfileRepository, scoped ICompetenceProfileService.
- Tests: 17 new application unit tests + 18 API integration tests (44 app + 35 API = 79 total, all green). TestAuthHandler extended to honour ClaimsIssuer as userId proxy for cross-user isolation tests. CreateClientForUser uses a fresh WebApplicationFactory to avoid duplicate scheme registration.

FRONTEND (9 new/modified files):
- competence-profile.model.ts: TypeScript interfaces mirroring C# record DTOs. DateOnly serialised as ISO date string.
- CompetenceProfileApiService: 10 typed HTTP methods, providedIn: root.
- CompetenceProfileStoreService: signal-based state (profile, loading, saving, error, activeForm). Optimistic local state update after mutations (no re-fetch needed). ActiveForm signal manages open/create/edit per entry type.
- Three form components (EducationEntryFormComponent, CertificateEntryFormComponent, CourseEntryFormComponent): Standalone, OnPush, ReactiveFormsModule, signal-based inputs. Certificate form includes cross-field expiration-date validator. Course form parses comma-separated skills into normalized array client-side (mirrors backend normalization).
- CompetenceProfilePageComponent: Groups all three sections with add/edit/delete affordances, inline forms, skill chips, empty states.
- app.routes.ts: /profile/competence lazy-loaded route.
- app.component.ts: Profile nav link added to shell header.

Build: 0 warnings backend, clean Angular build (lazy chunk competence-profile-page-component emitted). All 33 existing frontend tests still pass.
